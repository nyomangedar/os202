# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Binding Memory Addres](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/)
Address binding is the process of mapping from one address space to another address space.
 
2. [When do computer bind memory address?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/)<br>
Binding instructions and data to memory addresses can be done with these steps
	>Compile time
	If you know what compile time where the process will reside in memory, then absolute code can be generated.
	If, at some later time, the starting location changes, then it will be necessary to
	recompile this code.
	>Load time
	If it is not known at compile time where the process will reside in memory, then the compiler must generate relocatable code.
	If the starting address changes, we
	need only reload the user code to incorporate this changed value.
	>Execution time
	If the process can be moved during its execution fromone
	memory segment to another, then binding must be delayed until run time.
	Special hardware must be available for this scheme to work

3. [Logical Address vs Pyhsical Address Space](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-logical-and-physical-address.html)<br>
An address generated by the CPU is commonly referred to as a logical address,
whereas an address seen by the memory unit—that is, the one loaded into
the memory-address register of the memory—is commonly referred to as a physical address.


4. [Memory Management Unit (MMU) ](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/memory-management-unit-MMU)<br>
A memory management unit (MMU) is a computer hardware component that handles all memory and caching operations associated with the processor. 
In other words, the MMU is responsible for all aspects of memory management. It is usually integrated into the processor 
although in some systems it occupies a separate IC (integrated circuit) chip.

5. [Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Paging is a memory management scheme that permits a process’s physical address space to be non-contiguous. 
Paging avoids external fragmentation and the associated need for compaction, two problems that plague contiguous memory allocation.
 
6. [Transition Look Aside Buffer (TLB)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/translation-lookaside-buffer-tlb-in-paging/)<br>
The TLB is associative, high-speed memory. Each entry in the TLB consists of two parts: a key (or tag) and a value. 
When the associative memory is presented with an item, the item is compared with all keys simultaneously. 

7. [Implement Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
The basic method for implementing paging involves breaking physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called frames and breaking logical memory into
blocks of the same size called pages.

8. [Structure of the Page Table](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-page-table)<br>
> Hierarchical Paging
Because of the enourmous size of page table, we would not want to allocate all of the in the main memory
One simple solution to this problemis to divide the page table into smaller pieces. 
> Hashed Page Tables
One approach for handling address spaces larger than 32bits is to use a hashed page table 
with the hash value being the virtual page number. Each entry in the hash table contains a linked list of elements that hash to the same location (to handle collisions). 
> Inverted Page Tables
Since Operating System need to translate virtual address into physical address, this operation consume many memory.
Therefore, we can use inverted page table to solve this problem.

9. [Oracle SPARC Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system))<br>
Solaris running on the SPARC CPU is a fully 64-bit operating system and as such has to solve
the problem of virtual memory without using up all of its physical memory by keeping multiple levels of page tables. 
Its approach is a bit complex but solves the problem eficiently using hashed page tables.
 
10. [Swapping](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
Process instructions and the data they operate on must be in memory to be executed.  
However,  a process,  or a portion of a process,  can be swapped temporarily out of memory to a backing store and then brought back into memory for continued execution
Swapping makes it possible for the total physical address space of all processes to exceed the real physical
memory of the system, thus increasing the degree of multiprogramming in a system.
