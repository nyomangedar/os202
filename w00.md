# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [Driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver)<br>
Device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer.
A driver provides a software interface to hardware devices, enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise details about the hardware being used. 

2. [OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)<br>
Operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs
For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware

3. [OS design issues](https://www.ques10.com/p/25212/discuss-operating-system-design-issues/)<br>
The important issues related to Operating system are transparency, flexibility, reliability, performance, scalability, naming, replication, synchronization, security.
transparency : Make limit for user to access the system; Flexibility : with flexibility we can customize the OS depend with the constraints;
Reliability : The more realible the system, the less it will broke; Performance : The performance of computer hardware typically increases monotonically with time. 
Scability :  is a desirable property of a system, a network, or a process, which indicates its ability to either handle growing amounts of work in a graceful manner, or to be readily enlarged.
Naming : The resources in a distributed system are spread across different computers and a naming scheme has to be devised so that users can discover and refer to the resources that they need.

4. [Functionality of OS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_overview.htm)<br>
Memory Management,Processor Management, Device Management, File Management, Security, Control over system performance, Job accounting, Error detecting aids,
Coordination between other software and users

5. [Logical Layer](https://www.osdata.com/system/logical/logical.htm)<br>
The Logical Level of the operating system provides high level functions, such as file management, internet and networking facilities, etc.
The file system and the shell program (especially graphic shell programs) are the primary ways that the typical computer user experiences a computer. Many people think of an operating system as just these two elements.
The file system provides a logical manner for programs to access files. The actual data is stored as binary bits on a storage media (magnetic, optical, etc.), often with special information for error correction and other internal purposes. 
Data is usually stored in blocks â€” and there are numerous ways blocks can be organized on the physical medium. Rather than having each program directly access the hardware and correctly interpret the bit patterns of the physical media, operating systems provide a logical file system.

6. [Interrupt Handler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_handler)<br>
In computer systems programming, an interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service routine or ISR, is a special block of code associated with a specific interrupt condition. 
Interrupt handlers are initiated by hardware interrupts, software interrupt instructions, or software exceptions, and are used for implementing device drivers or transitions between protected modes of operation, such as system calls.

7. [Advance Programmable Interrupt Controler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller)<br>
In computing, Intel's Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) is a family of interrupt controllers. As its name suggests, the APIC is more advanced than Intel's 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC), particularly enabling the construction of multiprocessor systems. 
It is one of several architectural designs intended to solve interrupt routing efficiency issues in multiprocessor computer systems.

8. [Regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8)<br>
A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. 
It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.

9. [Multiprocessor System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9)<br>
Traditionally, such systems have two (or more) processors,  each with a single-core CPU.Theprocessors share the computer bus and sometimes the clock, memory, and periph-eral devices. 
The primary advantage of multiprocessor systems is increased throughput. That is, by increasing the number of processors, we expect to get more work done in less time.
The speed-up ratio with N processors is not N, however; it is less than N.

10. [Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)<br>
Process Synchronization means sharing system resources by processes in a such a way that, Concurrent access to shared data is handled thereby minimizing the chance of inconsistent data. 
Maintaining data consistency demands mechanisms to ensure synchronized execution of cooperating processes.
Process Synchronization was introduced to handle problems that arose while multiple process executions.
